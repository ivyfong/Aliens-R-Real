# Unit 14 â€“ JavaScript Homework, Aliens-R-Real

The objective of this project is to use JavaScript to append a UFO sightings dataset, originally stored in an array of JavaScript objects, as a table to a HTML file. Additionally, multiple input fields and an event handler are added to allow users to filter the displayed data by UFO sighting date/time, city, state, country, and shape.
